1, i live: inside a vineland, an eden, divine, alive in its tiniest detail;
2, still i insist: it is a land in leaden denial all tilted, all stained, all enslaved its senile daddies stall all vital ideals sell stale ideas instead and devise listless steals.;
3, it is all i detest : devilâ€™s land its natives ease all atavist needs vile teens taste tanned tits, eat svelte slits idle ladies in veils sin at tea in venitian tents;
4, still avid I leave: in lent, leaves still lean, i set sails - and leave at late tide.;
5, i see, i listen, i invent;
6, i see: valiant sea-tested vessels dive slain alive in intense evil and dead seas distended in vast vistas;
7, i invent tall tales at nite visit alien lands as a saint visits sins;
8, and as i stand livid in salient dissent still at sea, invalid and nestless;
9, i listen, i listen, a sentient island, insane and insatiate still, silent, alive, inside - a native land;
